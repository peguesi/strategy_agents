# ✅ Linear Workspace Generalized Successfully!

Your Linear workspace setup has been completely generalized and is now ready for sharing without exposing any of your specific business details.

## 🔒 What Was Protected

### **Your Original Files (Safely Archived)**
- `linear/archive/setup-linear-original.js` - Your specific Simply BAU setup
- `linear/archive/linear-initiative-fix-original.js` - Your initiative configuration

### **Personal References Removed**
- ❌ "Simply BAU" client references  
- ❌ "€50k" specific revenue targets
- ❌ German client property management details
- ❌ Specific team member names ("Jeremiah")
- ❌ Your actual project names and descriptions
