# Simply BAU - Discovery Session Planning
*Framework-Driven Discovery Structure*

---

## Discovery Scope Decision
*Based on intel processing and kickoff meeting outcomes*

### Selected Approach: [Update after kickoff]
- [ ] **Minimal Discovery** (1-2 focused sessions)
- [ ] **Moderate Discovery** (2-3 structured sessions)  
- [ ] **Comprehensive Discovery** (3-4 deep sessions)

### Rationale: [Why this scope was selected]
*Fill after kickoff meeting based on critical unknowns identified*

## Discovery Session Structure

### Session 1: [Focus Area Based on Critical Unknowns]
**Duration**: 90 minutes
**Objective**: [Primary validation goal]
**Attendees**: [Key stakeholders needed]

#### Pre-Session Preparation
- [ ] **Agenda sent**: 48 hours before session
- [ ] **Materials requested**: [Documentation, system access, data needed]
- [ ] **Stakeholders confirmed**: [Right people scheduled]

#### Session Focus Areas (Based on Framework)
**Problem Space Deep Dive** (30 min):
- Current process mapping and pain point identification
- User journey analysis and friction points
- Success criteria clarification and measurement

**Organizational Context Assessment** (30 min):
- Technical team capability and capacity assessment
- Change management readiness and historical context
- Resource allocation and priority validation

**Integration & Technical Discovery** (30 min):
- System architecture review and constraints
- Data flow analysis and integration requirements
- Security, compliance, and technical limitations

#### Validation Questions for Critical Unknowns
1. **[Critical Unknown from kickoff]**: 
   - **Question**: [Specific validation approach]
   - **Evidence needed**: [What would confirm/refute assumption]
   - **Decision impact**: [How this affects solution design]

2. **[Critical Unknown from kickoff]**:
   - **Question**: [Specific validation approach]
   - **Evidence needed**: [What would confirm/refute assumption]
   - **Decision impact**: [How this affects solution design]

### Session 2: [Focus Area] *(If needed based on scope)*
**Duration**: 90 minutes
**Objective**: [Secondary validation goal]
**Attendees**: [Additional or different stakeholders]

#### Session Focus Areas
**Scale & Growth Context** (45 min):
- Volume analysis and capacity planning
- Growth trajectory and scaling challenges
- Performance requirements and constraints

**Solution Context & Constraints** (45 min):
- Budget reality and investment parameters
- Timeline constraints and delivery expectations
- Risk tolerance and change capacity

### Session 3: [Focus Area] *(If comprehensive discovery)*
**Duration**: 90 minutes
**Objective**: [Additional validation needs]
**Attendees**: [Specialized stakeholders]

## Discovery Preparation Checklist

### Pre-Discovery Setup
- [ ] **Framework assessment updated**: Post-kickoff intelligence processed
- [ ] **Session agendas prepared**: Tailored to confirmed critical unknowns
- [ ] **Materials gathered**: Existing documentation and system access
- [ ] **Stakeholder mapping**: Right people scheduled for right sessions

### Discovery Tools & Methods
- [ ] **Process mapping tools**: For current state documentation
- [ ] **System documentation**: For technical architecture understanding
- [ ] **Workflow analysis**: For efficiency and automation opportunity identification
- [ ] **Interview guides**: Structured questions for each stakeholder type

### Post-Session Processing
- [ ] **Session notes template**: Consistent capture format
- [ ] **Action item tracking**: Follow-up responsibilities
- [ ] **Assumption validation**: Update confidence levels based on findings
- [ ] **Solution impact assessment**: How discoveries affect approach
