# Tool Selection Decision Framework

## Overview

Systematic methodology for evaluating and selecting tools/integrations, extracted from proven decision-making process in PEG-87 (MCP Integration Options Research & Selection).

## Framework Origin

**Source**: PEG-87 - Obsidian MCP server selection
**Success Rate**: 100% (selected option implemented successfully)  
**Reusability**: High - applies to all future tool integration decisions
**Revenue Impact**: Prevents costly tool selection mistakes, accelerates implementation

## Decision Triggers

Use this framework when:
- Multiple tool options available for same functionality
- Integration complexity requires systematic evaluation
- Strategic alignment crucial for long-term success
- Investment justification needed for tool selection

## Evaluation Criteria Matrix

### 1. Technical Compatibility (Weight: 30%)
- **Integration Requirements**: Compatibility with existing MCP architecture
- **Dependencies**: Minimal additional infrastructure needed
- **Performance**: Meets operational requirements
- **Reliability**: Proven stability and support

**Example from PEG-87**: 
- ✅ **cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server**: Full automation capabilities, REST API integration
- ⚠️ **StevenStavrakis/obsidian-mcp**: Limited automation features
- ✅ **MarkusPfundstein/mcp-obsidian**: Enhanced security, requires Obsidian running

### 2. Strategic Fit (Weight: 25%)
- **Revenue Alignment**: Direct contribution to €500k goal
- **Framework Integration**: Complements existing systems (Vector DB, Linear, n8n)
- **Scalability**: Supports future growth and team expansion
- **Cross-Project Value**: Enables multiple use cases

**Example from PEG-87**:
- **Strategic Requirement**: "Complement existing Vector DB memory without duplication"
- **Result**: Simplified two-system approach (Vector DB + Strategic Obsidian)

### 3. Implementation Complexity (Weight: 20%)
- **Setup Difficulty**: Time and expertise required
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing operational burden
- **Learning Curve**: Team adoption requirements
- **Documentation Quality**: Available support resources

### 4. Security & Operational (Weight: 15%)
- **Security Model**: Authentication and access control
- **Operational Requirements**: Always-on dependencies
- **Backup/Recovery**: Data protection capabilities
- **Compliance**: Regulatory considerations

### 5. Cost & ROI (Weight: 10%)
- **Direct Costs**: Licensing, subscription fees
- **Implementation Time**: Opportunity cost calculation
- **Maintenance Costs**: Ongoing operational expenses
- **ROI Timeline**: Expected payback period

## Decision Process

### Step 1: Option Identification
- Research available solutions (minimum 3 options)
- Document core capabilities for each option
- Identify unique differentiators

### Step 2: Criteria Scoring
- Score each option 1-10 on each criterion
- Apply weighted scoring based on strategic priorities
- Document reasoning for each score

### Step 3: Strategic Assessment
- Evaluate top 2 options against strategic requirements
- Consider integration complexity and future roadmap
- Assess risk factors and mitigation strategies

### Step 4: Decision Documentation
- Record final selection with justification
- Document implementation approach
- Plan success metrics and review timeline

## Success Patterns from PEG-87

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive Research**: Evaluated 3 distinct options with different approaches
2. **Clear Criteria**: Defined specific requirements (automation, security, integration)
3. **Strategic Alignment**: Focused on complementing existing infrastructure
4. **Implementation Planning**: Considered operational requirements upfront

### Key Decision Factors
- **Automation Capabilities**: Essential for n8n integration workflows
- **Existing Infrastructure Fit**: Must work with current MCP setup
- **Strategic Complementarity**: Enhance rather than duplicate Vector DB
- **Operational Simplicity**: Minimize maintenance overhead

## Framework Evolution

### Usage Tracking
- Record each tool selection using this framework
- Track implementation success rate
- Note criteria weightings that prove most predictive
- Update framework based on lessons learned

### Continuous Improvement
- Monthly review of framework effectiveness
- Adjust criteria weights based on actual outcomes
- Add new evaluation dimensions as business evolves
- Share learnings across similar decisions
