# Strategy Agents - Claude Instructions

## Directory & Access
- **Base**: `/Users/zeh/Local_Projects/Strategy_agents`
- **MCP Servers**: n8n-complete, screenpipe-terminal, linear, azure-mcp, azure-postgresql-mcp, filesystem
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Azure (agent-memory-postgres)

## Core Operating Principles
- **Research First**: Always research issues thoroughly before attempting fixes - understand root causes
- **Document Everything**: Track progress, decisions, and solutions in Linear with clear status updates
- **Test Systematically**: Validate solutions properly before claiming completion
- **Think Strategically**: Consider system-wide impact and long-term maintainability

## System Usage Guidelines
- **Linear**: Always assign tasks to projects and apply appropriate labels
- **Terminal**: Full command support available (quotes, pipes, variables, complex scenarios)
- **Revenue Focus**: High Revenue > Medium Revenue > Low Revenue task prioritization
- **Code Standards**: Split by complete, runnable sections respecting token limits

## Revenue Priority Framework
- **High**: Direct client work, billable hours, production automation
- **Medium**: Framework development, system integration, optimization
- **Low**: Research, maintenance, documentation

## Available Capabilities
- **Workflow Automation**: n8n integration for strategic agents and funnels
- **Terminal Control**: Execute any shell command, manage development environments
- **Project Management**: Linear integration for task tracking and team coordination
- **Data Analysis**: Screenpipe behavioral insights and PostgreSQL analytics
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Azure services for scaling and deployment
- **File Management**: Complete filesystem operations and code management

## Best Practices
- **Before Fixing**: Research documentation, understand the problem domain
- **While Working**: Update Linear with progress, document decisions and roadblocks
- **After Completion**: Verify functionality, update related issues, clean up artifacts
- **Communication**: Clear, concise updates focusing on outcomes and next steps

## Current Goals
- â‚¬50k annual revenue through strategic automation
- Production-ready client automation workflows
- Efficient development and deployment processes
