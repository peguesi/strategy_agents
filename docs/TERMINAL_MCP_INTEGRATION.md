## 🚀 Strategic Terminal Automation Scenarios

### Development Workflows
1. **Project Setup Automation**:
   ```
   "Clone the new client project repository, install dependencies, 
   set up environment variables, run initial tests, and start dev server"
   ```

2. **Deployment Pipeline**:
   ```
   "Build the project, run tests, deploy to staging, 
   verify deployment, and notify team of completion"
   ```

3. **Code Analysis & Debugging**:
   ```
   "Run linting on changed files, execute test suite, 
   analyze coverage report, and generate summary"
   ```

### System Administration
4. **Server Monitoring**:
   ```
   "Check system resources, monitor running processes, 
   analyze log files, and alert on any issues"
   ```

5. **Backup & Maintenance**:
   ```
   "Create database backup, clean temporary files, 
   update system packages, and verify system health"
   ```

### Strategic Integration
6. **Linear Issue → Development**:
   ```
   "Pull Linear issue details, create feature branch, 
   set up development environment, and start coding session"
   ```

7. **n8n Workflow Deployment**:
   ```
   "Export n8n workflows, commit to repository, 
   deploy to production, and verify workflow status"
   ```

8. **Screenpipe Analysis Automation**:
   ```
   "Query Screenpipe data, analyze productivity patterns, 
   generate reports, and optimize development setup"
   ```

## 📋 Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Install iTerm2 MCP (Recommended)
```bash
# Auto-install via Smithery
npx -y @smithery/cli install iterm-mcp --client claude

# Manual configuration
# Edit: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iterm-mcp": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "iterm-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Test Basic Terminal Control
```bash
# Test commands through Claude:
"What's in my current directory?"
"Run 'npm install' in the current project"
"Show me the last 10 lines of the git log"
"Start a Python REPL and calculate 2+2"
```

### Step 3: Strategic Workflow Integration
```bash
# Link to existing Strategy_agents infrastructure:
"Navigate to my Strategy_agents project"
"Run the n8n workflow sync script"
"Check the status of our workflows"
"Deploy the latest changes to Azure"
```

## 🔧 Advanced Terminal Configurations

### Multi-Terminal Setup
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iterm-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "iterm-mcp"]
    },
    "applescript-mcp": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@joshrutkowski/applescript-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations
- **Command Validation**: Always review commands before execution
- **Path Restrictions**: Use secure working directories
- **Process Monitoring**: Watch for runaway processes
- **Access Control**: Limit terminal privileges appropriately

## 🎯 Strategic Development Workflows

### 1. **Strategic Project Management**
```
"Review Linear high-revenue issues → Create development branches → 
Set up coding environment → Track time via Screenpipe → 
Commit progress → Update Linear status"
```

### 2. **Client Delivery Pipeline**
```
"Pull client requirements from Linear → Set up project structure → 
Run development workflow → Execute tests → Deploy to staging → 
Generate client report → Send via automated email"
```

### 3. **Infrastructure Management**
```
"Monitor Azure resources → Check n8n workflow health → 
Analyze system performance → Update configurations → 
Deploy optimizations → Report status to stakeholders"
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices
