## Discovery Scope Decision Framework

### Confidence Assessment Summary

- **High Confidence Areas**: Problem definition, user actors, existing systems, budget parameters, scope boundaries
- **Medium Confidence Areas**: Success criteria, volume data, change capacity, technical integrations
- **Low Confidence Areas**: Technical capability, compliance requirements, specific AI feasibility
- **Critical Unknowns**: 5 high-impact assumptions requiring validation

### Discovery Scope Recommendation

Based on confidence assessment:

- [X] **Moderate Discovery** (3-4 structured sessions)
    - _Criteria_: Mixed confidence levels, several critical unknowns with high decision impact
    - _Focus_: Critical unknown resolution + technical feasibility validation
    - _Timeline_: 2-3 weeks (Month 1 of engagement)

**Recommended Discovery Sessions:**

1. **Technical Feasibility Deep Dive** (90 min) - AI/automation capabilities, system integrations
2. **Data & Process Audit** (90 min) - Current state documentation, data quality assessment
3. **User Capability & Change Management** (60 min) - Team readiness, training requirements
4. **Legal & Compliance Requirements** (60 min) - German regulations, automation constraints

## Risk Assessment by Confidence Level

### High-Risk Factors (Low Confidence Intel)

- **Risk**: AI photo-measurement accuracy insufficient for business requirements
    
- **Mitigation**: Early technical validation with client sample data, fallback to manual measurement
    
- **Contingency**: Alternative workflow using digital measurement tools or hybrid approach
    
- **Risk**: Team technical capability insufficient for adoption
    
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training program, gradual rollout approach
    
- **Contingency**: Simplified interface design, extended support period, potential additional staff hire
    

### Medium-Risk Factors (Medium Confidence Intel)

- **Risk**: Integration complexity exceeds budget/timeline
    
- **Mitigation**: Thorough API assessment, build vs. buy analysis
    
- **Contingency**: Phased integration approach, manual bridge processes
    
- **Risk**: Legal compliance requirements add significant complexity
    
- **Mitigation**: Early legal research, compliant automation design
    
- **Contingency**: Manual compliance processes with automation support
    

### Low-Risk Factors (High Confidence Intel)

- **Validated Areas**: Budget confirmed, problem scope clear, user actors identified, existing systems documented

### WORKFLOW PROCESS MAPPING GAPS (Critical Oversight)

**From 17.06 Transcript Analysis - Missing Step-by-Step Details:**

**Greg's Putz Resource Estimation Process (HIGH PRIORITY GAP):**

- **What We Know**: Corner beads €1.50/unit, base coat €8.50/m², mesh €2/unit, Excel calculations
- **What We DON'T Know**:
    - How does he extract measurements from floorplans?
    - What specific calculations convert square meters to labor hours?
    - How does he factor in complexity (stairs, multiple rooms, prep work)?
    - What's the exact Excel formula structure for profitability?
    - How does he adjust pricing based on job size/margin requirements?
    - What tolerance levels are acceptable for automated calculations?

**Joe's Quote Generation Workflow (MEDIUM PRIORITY GAP):**

- **What We DON'T Know**:
    - Exact data extraction process from showroom PDFs
    - How he structures quotes in Towio (templates, line items, calculations)
    - Integration between showroom pricing and installation costs
    - How customer changes/revisions are handled
    - Quality control process for quote accuracy

**Jess's Rental Management Process (MEDIUM PRIORITY GAP):**

    - Search and retrieval process when information is needed
    - Document version control and approval workflows
    - Who has access to what information (permissions structure)
    - How project documents flow between Joe, Greg, and Jess

### Revised Critical Unknowns Matrix (Process-Detail Focused)

|Process Workflow Gap|Business Impact|Intel Confidence|Discovery Priority|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Greg's measurement→resource calculation steps**|HIGH|3/10|URGENT|
|**Joe's PDF→Towio data extraction process**|HIGH|4/10|URGENT|
|**Document filing and retrieval workflows**|MEDIUM|3/10|IMPORTANT|
|**Jess's tenant lifecycle management steps**|MEDIUM|4/10|IMPORTANT|
|**Inter-business project handoff processes**|MEDIUM|2/10|IMPORTANT|
|**Quality control and approval workflows**|LOW|3/10|NICE TO HAVE|

**Process Mapping Discovery Requirements:**

- **Shadow Sessions**: Observe actual work being performed
- **Workflow Documentation**: Step-by-step process capture
- **System Integration Points**: Where one process hands off to another
- **Exception Handling**: What happens when standard process breaks down
- **Performance Metrics**: How they currently measure success/quality

### Intelligence Baseline Review - CORRECTED

- **High Confidence Areas**: Business problems, stakeholder motivations, budget parameters
- **Medium Confidence Areas**: Tool usage, general workflows, technical capabilities
- **Low Confidence Areas**: **Detailed process steps, integration points, workflow dependencies**
- **Critical Unknowns**: **Step-by-step operational processes that automation must replicate**

**OVERLOOKED TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY INDICATORS:**

From contract transcript analysis, several signals suggest higher complexity than Work Order accounts for:

1. **Joe's Photo-to-Measurement "Holy Grail" Request**
    
    - Contract Evidence: Joe explicitly called this his "holy grail" solution
    - Complexity Signal: Advanced computer vision AI required
    - Work Order Gap: Not specifically addressed as high-complexity item
2. **Greg's Profitability Calculation Requirements**
    
    - Contract Evidence: Complex Excel calculations for labor, materials, timing
    - Complexity Signal: Multi-variable cost modeling required
    - Work Order Gap: Simplified as "quote generation" but requires sophisticated calculation engine
3. **Cross-Business Data Integration Needs**
    
    - Contract Evidence: Documents scattered across email, Outlook, Trello, WhatsApp
    - Complexity Signal: Multi-system data normalization and integration
    - Work Order Gap: Listed as "AI enabled data organization" but requires complex ETL processes

### Revised Critical Unknowns Matrix (Work Order Informed)

|Work Order Commitment|Intel Gap|Business Impact|Technical Complexity|Validation Priority|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Co-living key management**|HIGH|HIGH|UNKNOWN|URGENT|
|**Drawing → 2D automation**|MEDIUM|HIGH|VERY HIGH|URGENT|
|**Legal Mahnungen compliance**|HIGH|HIGH|MEDIUM|URGENT|
|**Material management integration**|HIGH|MEDIUM|MEDIUM|IMPORTANT|
|**Field coordination automation**|MEDIUM|MEDIUM|MEDIUM|IMPORTANT|
|**Cross-system data integration**|MEDIUM|HIGH|HIGH|URGENT|
