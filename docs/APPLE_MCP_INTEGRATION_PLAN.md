# 🍎 Apple/macOS MCP Integration Plan

## Overview
Adding native macOS MCPs will give you complete system access through Claude, enabling seamless automation across all Apple applications and system functions. This bridges the final gap between your strategic workflows and full system control.

## 🎯 Strategic Impact

### Current State

### Missing Link: **Complete System Access**
❌ **Native app control** (Mail, Messages, Calendar, Notes)  
❌ **File system automation** (Finder, file operations)  
❌ **Terminal/development workflow** integration  
❌ **Cross-app workflows** (email → calendar → reminders)

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Apple MCP Setup (30 minutes)
1. **Install Primary MCP**:
   ```bash
   npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @Dhravya/apple-mcp --client claude
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "apple-mcp": {
         "command": "bunx",
         "args": ["--no-cache", "apple-mcp@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Grant Permissions**:
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
   - Enable Claude Desktop access to all applications
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility  
   - Add Claude Desktop to accessibility apps

### Phase 2: Advanced System Control (15 minutes)
1. **Add AppleScript MCP**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "apple-mcp": {
         "command": "bunx",
         "args": ["--no-cache", "apple-mcp@latest"]
       },
       "applescript-mcp": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@joshrutkowski/applescript-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Test Core Functions**:
   - "Send a test message to yourself"
   - "Create a reminder for tomorrow"
   - "What's on my calendar today?"

### Phase 3: Integration with Existing Stack (30 minutes)
1. **Connect to Linear Workflows**:
   - Create shortcuts for high-revenue issue management
   - Set up automated calendar blocking for deep work
   - Link Screenpipe insights to reminder creation

2. **Enhance n8n Workflows**:
   - Add native notifications to workflow completion
   - Create email sequences for client communication
   - Set up calendar integration for strategic planning

## 🎯 Strategic Advantage

### Before Apple MCPs:
- Manual context switching between tools
- Fragmented workflow execution  
- Limited system-wide automation
- Strategic insights trapped in individual tools

### After Apple MCPs:
- **Seamless workflow execution** across all apps
- **Intelligent context preservation** between tasks
- **Complete system orchestration** from single interface
- **Strategic insights → immediate action** automation

## 🔮 Advanced Scenarios (Once Implemented)

### 1. **Strategic Daily Orchestration**
```
"Analyze my Screenpipe focus patterns from yesterday, 
review Linear high-revenue issues, block optimal calendar time 
for deep work, set contextual reminders, and send team updates"
```

### 2. **Client Opportunity Pipeline**
```
"When client inquiry email arrives, extract requirements, 
create Linear discovery project with revenue estimates, 
schedule initial call, add to CRM, and send custom proposal template"
```

### 3. **Revenue Goal Tracking**
```
"Check Simply BAU progress, calculate monthly runway, 
create visual progress report, schedule review meetings, 
and send strategic updates to stakeholders"
```
