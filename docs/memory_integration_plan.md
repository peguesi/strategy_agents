# PEG-51 Memory Integration Implementation Plan

## Current Status
✅ Infrastructure complete and operational
✅ Database verified with conversation data
✅ Strategic PM Agent workflow identified

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Memory Retrieval Integration
1. **Create enhanced agent prompt** that queries memory before responding
2. **Add memory search node** to Strategic PM Agent workflow  
3. **Test similarity-based retrieval** for relevant past conversations
4. **Validate improved contextual responses**

### Phase 2: Automatic Memory Storage
1. **Add conversation logging** after each agent interaction
2. **Generate embeddings** for new conversations
3. **Store with metadata** including context and outcomes
4. **Verify continuous learning loop**

### Phase 3: Learning & Optimization  
1. **Track suggestion outcomes** and user preferences
2. **Optimize similarity thresholds** for relevance
3. **Implement pattern recognition** for recurring issues
4. **Measure improvement** in suggestion quality

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Write implementation plan (current)
2. Create memory-enhanced agent workflow
3. Test retrieval and response improvement
4. Implement continuous learning loop

## Success Metrics
- Agent shows contextual awareness of previous conversations
- Responses reference relevant past insights
- No significant performance degradation
- Measurable improvement in suggestion relevance
