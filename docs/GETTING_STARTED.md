# Getting Started - Strategy Agents System

> **Goal**: Create an intelligent system that captures your work patterns, automates strategic decisions, and amplifies your productivity through AI agents.

## üéØ What This System Does

This system transforms your digital behavior into strategic intelligence by:
- **Capturing Everything**: Your screen activity, app usage, and work patterns via Screenpipe
- **Understanding Context**: AI analyzes what you're working on and how you work best
- **Automating Decisions**: Creates tasks, manages projects, and optimizes workflows automatically
- **Strategic Intelligence**: Turns daily activities into long-term strategic insights

## üìã Prerequisites

- **macOS or Linux** (Windows support limited for Screenpipe)
- **Claude Pro subscription** (for desktop app and API access)
- **Linear workspace** (project management)
- **GitHub account** (code repositories)
- **Terminal comfort** (basic command line usage)

---

## üöÄ Setup Order (Critical - Follow This Sequence)

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

#### Step 1: Get Claude Desktop + MCP
```bash
# 1. Download Claude Desktop from anthropic.com
# 2. Install and sign in with your Claude Pro account

# 3. Verify MCP support is enabled in Claude Desktop settings
# Settings > Features > Model Context Protocol should be ON
```

#### Step 2: Enable Terminal & File Access
```bash
# Create MCP configuration file
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-desktop
cat > ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "screenpipe-terminal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username
# Restart Claude Desktop
```

> **Why This Order**: Claude needs terminal and file access BEFORE we install other components. This lets Claude help you with the rest of the setup.

### Phase 2: Screenpipe Installation (Major Component)

#### Step 3: Install Screenpipe
```bash
# Option A: Using Homebrew (Recommended)
brew install screenpipe

# Option B: Download from screenpipe.ai
# Download the .dmg file and install manually

# Option C: Build from source (if you want latest features)
git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe
cd screenpipe
cargo install --path .
```

#### Step 4: Configure Screenpipe
```bash
# Start screenpipe for first time
screenpipe

# This will:
# 1. Ask for screen recording permissions
# 2. Ask for microphone permissions (optional but recommended)
# 3. Create ~/.screenpipe/ directory
# 4. Start capturing your activity

# Keep this running in the background
```

#### Step 5: Test Screenpipe Integration
```bash
# In Claude Desktop, test the connection:
# "Can you search my recent screenpipe activity?"
# Claude should now be able to see your screen activity
```

### Phase 3: Project Management Setup

#### Step 6: Linear Configuration
```bash
# 1. Create Linear workspace at linear.app
# 2. Get your API key: Linear Settings > API > Personal API Keys
# 3. Note your workspace URL and team IDs

# Add Linear to Claude Desktop config
cat > ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "screenpipe-terminal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

#### Step 7: n8n Workflow Engine
```bash
# Install n8n globally
npm install -g n8n

# Start n8n
n8n start

# Access at http://localhost:5678
# Set up your first workflow connecting Linear + Claude API
```

### Phase 4: Strategy Agents Activation

#### Step 8: Clone Strategy Agents Repository
```bash
# Create your projects directory
mkdir -p ~/Local_Projects
cd ~/Local_Projects

# Clone the strategy agents system
git clone https://github.com/your-username/strategy-agents.git
cd strategy-agents

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### Step 9: Configure Agent System
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your credentials
nano .env

# Required variables:
# CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
# LINEAR_API_KEY=your_linear_api_key  
# SCREENPIPE_URL=http://localhost:3030
# N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
```

#### Step 10: Start the Agent System
```bash
# Start all agents
npm run start:agents

# This launches:
# - Research Inspiration Agent (monitors Instagram/social)
# - Strategic PM Agent (manages Linear tasks)
# - Productivity Pattern Agent (analyzes screenpipe data)
# - Revenue Optimization Agent (tracks business metrics)
```

## üõ† Customization Guide

### Adding New Agents
```javascript
// Create new agent file: agents/my-custom-agent.js
const agent = {
  name: 'MyCustomAgent',
  triggers: ['specific_events'],
  actions: async (data) => {
    // Your agent logic
  }
};

export default agent;
```

### Modifying Screenpipe Filters
```javascript
// Edit config/screenpipe-filters.json
{
  "apps_to_monitor": ["Instagram", "LinkedIn", "Claude"],
  "keywords_to_track": ["AI", "automation", "strategy"],
  "minimum_session_length": 30
}
```

### Custom Linear Labels
The system uses intelligent labeling:
- **Size**: XS, S, M, L, XL (effort estimation)
- **Revenue**: High/Medium/Low Revenue (business impact)
- **Type**: Client Work, Research, Implementation, Strategy
- **Focus**: Deep-Work, Quick-Win, Related Automation
